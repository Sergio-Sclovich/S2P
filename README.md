convert STRUCTURE (https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html) indfiles 
to 
PONG (https://github.com/ramachandran-lab/pong) input files

Usage:

1)create a directory "indfiles"

2)put all the STRUCTURE files in that folder. Name the files Ki.indfile, being i the number of groups (i.e K2.indfile for 2 groups)

3)run the script from where the "infiles" folder is

the path to "indfiles" is set with "/" so it works on unix
